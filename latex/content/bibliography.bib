In this project work, we are going to extracting data about a mobile product from Flipkart. Manufacturers may want to analyze customer's opinions which like the product and the service. Product reviews from Flipkart is an unstructured data set, it is a collection of information from people entered his/her feelings, opinion, attitudes, product reviews, emotions, etc. Data pre-processing is an important tool for data mining algorithm. Then filter the data. Further, we will do sentimental analysis using the machine learning technique with the pre-processed data to find the response of a product from the customer. This work is easy to identify people's reactions/opinions. We are going to use graphical representation to display the analyzed data.},

	abstract = {Customer insighs is the key to the success of e-commerce. Therefore, factors affecting customer satisfaction leading to product purchase and re-purchase should be studied extensively. This study intends to identify the key drivers that influence the satisfaction and the model which can predict the likelihood of customer satisfaction. The outcome would provide insights to prioritise factors that are significant, as well as to provide advice to a wide range of sellers. Four classification machine learning algorithms decision tree, random forest, artificial neural network and support vector machine are evaluated to classify customer satisfaction based on a 3-year historical data from an e-commerce retailer. There were a few challenges with the dataset, such as imbalanced, skewed and missing. Data pre-processing was conducted, and different techniques were evaluated. Of the algorithms evaluated, the best result is achieved by Random Forest with the highest accuracy and reasonable processing time. Meeting the estimated delivery date and the number of days taken to deliver an order is found to be the top two important factors affecting customer satisfaction.},

	title = {Optimization of E-Commerce Logistics System Based on Artificial Intelligence Technology},
	journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
	abstract = {With the improvement of China’s social and economic development level, the requirements for logistics efficiency are becoming more and more stringent. Artificial intelligence technology is the current direction of vigorous development. With the development of the Chinese era, in order to better promote the development of China’s urbanization, this technology has been widely used in various fields in our country and occupies an important position in various fields. With the continuous innovation of artificial intelligence technology, various industries are undergoing industrial upgrading and format conversion. E-commerce logistics bear the brunt. This article mainly discusses the application of artificial intelligence in the e-commerce logistics system, and applies it to the e-commerce logistics industry. With the help of artificial intelligence algorithms, it is used to accurately calculate the supply and demand relationship of goods and the optimal path of actual logistics distribution. The selection provides algorithm-level support. The use of artificial intelligence can not only accurately predict inventory, but also play a role in optimizing inventory measures. With this technology, the automation level of the logistics sorting period can be effectively improved, highlighting the application value of artificial intelligence technology and promoting China the development process of modern e-commerce logistics industry makes it possible to develop in the direction of intelligence and automation. The experimental results show that the e-commerce logistics industry has great convenience for the sales and transportation of goods under the condition of combining artificial intelligence technology, and it has higher efficiency than traditional e-commerce logistics.},

The Internet has created a means for e-Commerce the internet has created a way to provide a unique avenue for companies and customers to sell and buy goods and services. When creating an e-commerce website, there are several goals that must be taken into account, one of them is how to Increase the site’s efficiency to ensure customer turnout and thus achieve the required material profits. There are several methods that are followed to increase the efficiency of the site. One of these methods is the recommender system. This paper produces a study overview of the value of recommended systems and thoroughly analyzed Collaborative Recommender System (CF) techniques with its techniques., which presents proposals to customers according to their interests, making it easier for the customer to search and thus choose the goods that suit him.},

It must be adopted in the early stage of SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) to avoid issues in a later stage. Today, E-commerce has revolutionized the mode of shopping, and thus, we need to focus on ways to improve the usability of e-commerce applications. We opted for survey questionnaires as our research methodology, along with testing websites using online tools based on the four parameters Connectivity, Readability, Accessibility, and Functional Performance. In the survey, the four most popular e-commerce applications were Amazon, Flipkart, Bigbasket, and Paytm. Out of which, Amazon was the most used e-commerce application by the consumers. Although, testing tools are depicted that applications need to improve in certain areas. From the analysis, we concluded that consumers are aware of the upcoming Jio-Mart, which can give tough competition to existing companies. Thus, all the existing e-commerce companies need to improve their web and mobile applications to retain their customer base.},
